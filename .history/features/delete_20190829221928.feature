Feature: Deleting Computers
  As a user
  I should be able to delete computers from the table
  In order to convenient table usage

  Scenario: Filter finds computers by name
    Given the site "http://computer-database.herokuapp.com/computers" is opened
    When I add "Super Puper" in the search field
    And I click the filter button
    And I should see "Super Puper" in the Computer name field
    When I click "Super Puper" in the Table
    And I click Delete this computer button
    Then I should see the following message "Done! Computer has been deleted"
